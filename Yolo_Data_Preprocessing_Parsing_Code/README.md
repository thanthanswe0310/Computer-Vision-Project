# Yolo_Data_Preprocessing_Parsing_Code
This is data preprocessing parsing code in Yolo format.

Collected data is converted into images and then they are annotated in roboflow using Yolov5 or Yolov7 based on their needs. However, some images have wrong annotation, missing label name and misinterpretation , etc. Therefore, the wrong interpretation data are needed to make data preprocessing steps according to convert in an accurate way before training a model.
